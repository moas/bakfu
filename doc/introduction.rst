Introduction
============

Bakfu is a toolkit based (mostly) on `scikit-learn`_.

It is meant to be a practical tool able to fetch data and use external librairies in an easy and streamlined way.

If you want to dive into the subject you should check out the :ref:`quickstart`.

.. note::
    The librairy is still far from complete.


.. note::
    The documentation is (also) still far from complete.
